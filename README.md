# CAR-COLLISION-GAME
I have built a car collision game which uses JavaScript concepts for its working and HTML, CSS are used for its structure and designing.
I have created this game with a clean user interface that can be used by users easily. I will start by creating the HTML layout first that defines the structure of the game, make it look good by styling using CSS and then write the game logic for all the functions in JavaScript.
I have used Play/pause button for better interaction. I am also calculating the live scores for the session. It is a typical car collision game which I are playing from our old times in the keypad phone.
In order to play this game, you must click on the start button then play button. You can play this game with the arrow keys and touch pad for moving left, right. When your car collides with another car coming from opposite direction, you will lose. And the score and restart button displayed on the screen.
